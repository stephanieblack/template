    </div>
    <p class="lead">This self-study manual has grown out of a commitment to re-envision the accreditation process for independent schools.  It took its shape in response to extensive feedback from CAIS school heads, along with three years of deliberations among the members of the Joint Accreditation Review Committee (JARC), which was co-sponsored by the California Association of Independent Schools and the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this manual&mdash;currently in its &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; phase&mdash;represents a significant departure from the one it replaces, it continues to have quality assurance and school improvement as its central purposes.&nbsp; We believe that such improvement best results from a process that is fundamentally oriented around teaching and learning, that calls for analysis and reflection rather than exhaustive description and reporting, and that favors depth over breadth.&nbsp; Schools using this manual will be asked to focus on key challenges and opportunities&mdash;the most important projects and problems to which the school wants to devote its resources in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that we viewed those challenges and opportunities not only as addressing deficiencies, but also as preserving and building on strengths.&nbsp; The Committee shared a conviction about the importance of making accreditation a process that helped schools to do both: identify and address strengths as well areas needing improvement.&nbsp; We noted often in our deliberative discussions that in its progress report, a school currently has to respond <em>only</em> to major recommendations.&nbsp; With the aim of moving away from a deficit-driven model of accreditation, we have done our best to construct questions that invite schools to be honest, reflective, and <em>gratified </em>by the process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This manual&mdash;and the process that it embodies&mdash;is designed for CAIS member schools to use in creating their self-studies, whether they are to be accredited only by CAIS or jointly by CAIS and WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges).&nbsp; As one of the six regional accrediting associations in the United States, WASC has productively partnered with CAIS for decades in tailoring the general accreditation process to address the distinctive realities and challenges faced by independent schools.&nbsp; In assessing whether a given school is deserving of accredited status, the focus will remain on two key factors: how well the school lives up to its own stated mission and how effectively it meets or exceeds the 16 standards articulated in this manual.&nbsp; As in the past, rigorous peer review will provide professional insight into these dual considerations.&nbsp; In the end, we hope that the reinvigorated process in this new manual will provide the impetus for schools to focus ever more keenly on the learning and growth of today&rsquo;s students&mdash;on the practices that will ensure the long-term sustainability necessary for schools to be able to serve future generations of students as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Each major chapter in this manual has a reformulated format and focuses on one of the 16 standards.&nbsp; Every standard is preceded by a context statement and is followed by a list of indicators, which elaborate on sound practices that are characteristic of schools that successfully meet the standard.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Baseline Requirements Checklist&rdquo; follows, identifying essential stipulations that all schools are typically expected to meet and which can be verified with straightforward &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; responses from the school.&nbsp; Finally, each section has a number of essay questions designed to promote in-depth institutional self-reflection with regard to the given standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> In addition to restructuring the chapters of the new manual, there are also numerous changes that we have instituted to make the process less ponderous and perfunctory.&nbsp; Those changes include (but are hardly limited to) the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>eliminating the criteria and limiting the standards to <em>one</em> per chapter</li>
	<li>significantly reducing the number, while improving the quality, of the questions (134 in the new manual compared with 201 in the former manual)</li>
	<li>relegating the consideration of &ldquo;baseline requirements&rdquo; to an easy-to-answer checklist, which will save schools from writing extended responses to questions that can generally be answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;</li>
	<li>eliminating the &ldquo;Statistical Supplement&rdquo; and introducing the much more dynamic Independent School Dashboard&mdash;which will be of ongoing value to schools</li>
	<li>assisting schools in understanding what facilitates and what gets in the way of school growth and change (to that end, we have included important new sections on climate and community as well as on assessment and decision-making).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> The new manual also includes three other significant departures from past practice that merit special mention.&nbsp; The manual now includes a preschool chapter, a fitting addition given that nearly 40% of CAIS members enroll preschool students.&nbsp; Additionally, the chapter that focuses on the educational program has been significantly redesigned.&nbsp; The Committee decided against requiring schools to write reports for <em>each</em> academic department.&nbsp; We have surely left ample opportunity for all schools to engage substantively in those program elements that are worthy of describing, exploring, or even debating.&nbsp; But in our commitment to help schools capture and reflect on their most essential qualities, concerns, and aspirations, we decided against mandating lengthy reports from individual academic departments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This innovation will allow schools more freedom to structure institutional discussions regarding program around elements of mission, strategic goals, research themes, or interdisciplinary considerations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Finally&mdash;and perhaps most importantly&mdash;we wanted to ensure that self-reflection and rich internal dialogue continue beyond the completion and submission of a self-study document.&nbsp; That is why we have separated the task of generating a forward-thinking document on the school&rsquo;s strategic priorities (formerly called an &ldquo;action plan&rdquo;) from the completion of the school&rsquo;s self-study.&nbsp; This will enable schools to take meaningful advantage of the feedback they receive from the visiting team and to integrate it not only with the self-study findings, but also with other institutional processes (such as strategic planning) that allow for a truly consolidated approach to mapping the school&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; And, we hope, it will also help make in-depth reflection and analysis part of what every school engages in, and is rewarded by, long after the formal self-study has been completed. &nbsp;</p>

    <p class="lead"><p>The school&rsquo;s introduction to its self-study is a narrative profile of the school that contains descriptive and identifying information and basic overview data to provide a sense of the school and its context for the Visiting Committee, the CAIS Boards of Standards, and the WASC Commission.&nbsp; The profile should be specific and documentary rather than aspirational. This introduction should be approximately 750 to 1500 words.</p>

<p>The following are intended as prompts to assist the school in writing the introduction, although other information that the school deems important can also be included:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Summarize the history of the school, its nature and scope, its founding philosophy, and its current mission.</li>
	<li>Provide the important basic facts of the school (<em>e.g</em>. location, size of campus, number of students and faculty, leadership structure, etc.)</li>
	<li>Describe the racial, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic mix of the student and faculty populations.</li>
	<li>Provide information on such considerations as local area demographics and parent occupations, if available.</li>

<h2 id="section3"> 3.The Student Learning Experience</h2>
<hr>
<p><em>Independent schools have historically prided themselves on the individual attention that they are able to provide for each student, and this traditional commitment underscores the critical importance of making each student&rsquo;s learning experience as positive as possible. &nbsp;To accomplish this, schools need to develop sophisticated understandings of how different students learn, and they need thoughtful assessment systems that yield useful data that can aid teachers and administrators in most effectively shaping the learning environment for students. &nbsp;Only schools that are dedicated and successful in these endeavors will be able to maximize the effectiveness of their carefully crafted educational programs as the students experience them in daily interaction with the faculty.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Standard 3:</strong> <strong>The school maintains a vigorous and informed focus on the learning of each student. It has policies, expectations, procedures, assessment systems, and student feedback mechanisms that enable it to engage&mdash;and maximize the learning potential of&mdash;each student.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Indicators of meeting Standard 3: </strong><em>Schools that are meeting the standard at a high level will typically exhibit most or all of the following indicators.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The school has a clear published statement that communicates its fundamental beliefs and assumptions about how students best learn, along with an explanation of what those beliefs and assumptions are based upon.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school has developed procedures to help all students understand how they learn and how they can improve their ability to learn.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The faculty and administration are attuned to and recognize differences in learning styles, abilities, and approaches among students, including those that may be influenced by such considerations as previous preparation, developed competence, neuropsychological factors, socioeconomic situation, gender, culture, race, and ethnicity.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school has developed a thoughtful, in-depth, and multi-faceted system of student assessment, which compels teachers and administrators to gather and analyze important evidence regarding each student&rsquo;s learning and to implement strategies that will help each student to reach his or her potential.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are established structures and time allotments for teachers to meet at regularly scheduled intervals and review the achievement and engagement of individual students and groups of students.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school has established procedures to regularly inform parents about student progress.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There is an age-appropriate system in place for counseling students (and, when necessary, parents) regarding academic and social issues.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>There are established procedures that the school uses to help students who struggle with learning, and there are resources available (within and beyond the school) to the faculty and administration to assist them in identifying and meeting the learning needs of individual students.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school has a process in place to identify students whom it can no longer serve effectively and to counsel them in a supportive way regarding more suitable schooling options.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school has a structured, ongoing process through which it solicits and analyzes the perspectives of students and alumni/ae about their experience of the school, and it uses the information from this process to strengthen the school and improve learning.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The school actively strives to create a daily schedule and an annual calendar that allow for students to be productively challenged and engaged, while avoiding structures and practices that lead to unmanageable student workloads and debilitating stress.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Students themselves express a high level of enthusiasm for and engagement with their academic work in particular and their school experience in general.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Parents generally observe and report that their children have a high level of interest and engagement in learning at the school.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Age-appropriate opportunities are in place for students to provide feedback on their experience of the teaching and learning environment of the school.</p>
