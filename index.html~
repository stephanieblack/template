      <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">This self-study manual has grown out of a commitment to re-envision the accreditation process for independent schools.  It took its shape in response to extensive feedback from CAIS school heads, along with three years of deliberations among the members of the Joint Accreditation Review Committee (“JARC”), which was co-sponsored by the California Association of Independent Schools and the Hawaii Association of Independent Schools.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this manual&mdash;currently in its &ldquo;pilot&rdquo; phase&mdash;represents a significant departure from the one it replaces, it continues to have quality assurance and school improvement as its central purposes.&nbsp; We believe that such improvement best results from a process that is fundamentally oriented around teaching and learning, that calls for analysis and reflection rather than exhaustive description and reporting, and that favors depth over breadth.&nbsp; Schools using this manual will be asked to focus on key challenges and opportunities&mdash;the most important projects and problems to which the school wants to devote its resources in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important to emphasize that we viewed those challenges and opportunities not only as addressing deficiencies, but also as preserving and building on strengths.&nbsp; The Committee shared a conviction about the importance of making accreditation a process that helped schools to do both: identify and address strengths as well areas needing improvement.&nbsp; We noted often in our deliberative discussions that in its progress report, a school currently has to respond <em>only</em> to major recommendations.&nbsp; With the aim of moving away from a deficit-driven model of accreditation, we have done our best to construct questions that invite schools to be honest, reflective, and <em>gratified </em>by the process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This manual&mdash;and the process that it embodies&mdash;is designed for CAIS member schools to use in creating their self-studies, whether they are to be accredited only by CAIS or jointly by CAIS and WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges).&nbsp; As one of the six regional accrediting associations in the United States, WASC has productively partnered with CAIS for decades in tailoring the general accreditation process to address the distinctive realities and challenges faced by independent schools.&nbsp; In assessing whether a given school is deserving of accredited status, the focus will remain on two key factors: how well the school lives up to its own stated mission and how effectively it meets or exceeds the 16 standards articulated in this manual.&nbsp; As in the past, rigorous peer review will provide professional insight into these dual considerations.&nbsp; In the end, we hope that the reinvigorated process in this new manual will provide the impetus for schools to focus ever more keenly on the learning and growth of today&rsquo;s students&mdash;on the practices that will ensure the long-term sustainability necessary for schools to be able to serve future generations of students as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Each major chapter in this manual has a reformulated format and focuses on one of the 16 standards.&nbsp; Every standard is preceded by a context statement and is followed by a list of indicators, which elaborate on sound practices that are characteristic of schools that successfully meet the standard.&nbsp; A &ldquo;Baseline Requirements Checklist&rdquo; follows, identifying essential stipulations that all schools are typically expected to meet and which can be verified with straightforward &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; responses from the school.&nbsp; Finally, each section has a number of essay questions designed to promote in-depth institutional self-reflection with regard to the given standard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> In addition to restructuring the chapters of the new manual, there are also numerous changes that we have instituted to make the process less ponderous and perfunctory.&nbsp; Those changes include (but are hardly limited to) the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>eliminating the criteria and limiting the standards to <em>one</em> per chapter</li>
	<li>significantly reducing the number, while improving the quality, of the questions (134 in the new manual compared with 201 in the former manual)</li>
	<li>relegating the consideration of &ldquo;baseline requirements&rdquo; to an easy-to-answer checklist, which will save schools from writing extended responses to questions that can generally be answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;</li>
	<li>eliminating the &ldquo;Statistical Supplement&rdquo; and introducing the much more dynamic Independent School Dashboard&mdash;which will be of ongoing value to schools</li>
	<li>assisting schools in understanding what facilitates and what gets in the way of school growth and change (to that end, we have included important new sections on climate and community as well as on assessment and decision-making).</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> The new manual also includes three other significant departures from past practice that merit special mention.&nbsp; The manual now includes a preschool chapter, a fitting addition given that nearly 40% of CAIS members enroll preschool students.&nbsp; Additionally, the chapter that focuses on the educational program has been significantly redesigned.&nbsp; The Committee decided against requiring schools to write reports for <em>each</em> academic department.&nbsp; We have surely left ample opportunity for all schools to engage substantively in those program elements that are worthy of describing, exploring, or even debating.&nbsp; But in our commitment to help schools capture and reflect on their most essential qualities, concerns, and aspirations, we decided against mandating lengthy reports from individual academic departments.&nbsp;&nbsp; This innovation will allow schools more freedom to structure institutional discussions regarding program around elements of mission, strategic goals, research themes, or interdisciplinary considerations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Finally&mdash;and perhaps most importantly&mdash;we wanted to ensure that self-reflection and rich internal dialogue continue beyond the completion and submission of a self-study document.&nbsp; That is why we have separated the task of generating a forward-thinking document on the school&rsquo;s strategic priorities (formerly called an &ldquo;action plan&rdquo;) from the completion of the school&rsquo;s self-study.&nbsp; This will enable schools to take meaningful advantage of the feedback they receive from the visiting team and to integrate it not only with the self-study findings, but also with other institutional processes (such as strategic planning) that allow for a truly consolidated approach to mapping the school&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; And, we hope, it will also help make in-depth reflection and analysis part of what every school engages in, and is rewarded by, long after the formal self-study has been completed. &nbsp;</p>

    </div>
    <p class="lead"><p>The school&rsquo;s introduction to its self-study is a narrative profile of the school that contains descriptive and identifying information and basic overview data to provide a sense of the school and its context for the Visiting Committee, the CAIS Boards of Standards, and the WASC Commission.&nbsp; The profile should be specific and documentary rather than aspirational. This introduction should be approximately 750 to 1500 words.</p>

<p>The following are intended as prompts to assist the school in writing the introduction, although other information that the school deems important can also be included:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Summarize the history of the school, its nature and scope, its founding philosophy, and its current mission.</li>
	<li>Provide the important basic facts of the school (<em>e.g</em>. location, size of campus, number of students and faculty, leadership structure, etc.)</li>
	<li>Describe the racial, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic mix of the student and faculty populations.</li>
	<li>Provide information on such considerations as local area demographics and parent occupations, if available.</li>
	<li>Describe the structure and composition of the school&rsquo;s Board of Trustees.</li>
	<li>Describe the general financial circumstances of the school.</li>
	<li>Provide summary information about the faculty.</li>
	<li>Provide summary information about the alumni/ae.</li>
	<li>Give examples of any distinctive identifying features of the school.</li>
	<li>Briefly mention any significant institutional changes that have occurred since the prior accreditation.</li>
	<li>Add other information that might be useful to help the Visiting Committee understand the school.</li>

<h1>The Self-Study Process</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the School Profile, please provide a list, including names and titles, of the members of the school&rsquo;s self-study Steering Committee.&nbsp; In addition, given that the school is expected to employ a collaborative approach in generating the self-study, please describe and evaluate the process used by the school in producing the self-study (this should be approximately one page or less).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
